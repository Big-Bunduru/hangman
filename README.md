Hangman app

5.11.2020: I've pushed a basic skeleton to my branch. I've added comments throughout my code to make it easier to follow. 

One useful package from my JS boot camp class -- live-server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server)
Basically you run 'live-server foldername' and it serves up the entire folder in your browser (granted there's an index.html file in that folder). Useful for standing up code and testing it quickly.
